        <h2>Molars</h2>
        <p>Your molars are your largest teeth. Their function is similar to that of the premolars, to grind, tear, and crush food. Molars have a large flat biting surface which makes them perfect for this job.

        <h2>Incisors</h2>
        <p>Your incisors are eight teeth in the front center of your mouth (four on both bottom and top). These are typically the first adult teeth that a child will get, coming in  when the child is between six and eight years old. Incisors are the teeth that you use to bite into your food. </p>

        <p>Your canines are the next teeth that develop in your mouth. You have four of them and they are your sharpest teeth, used for tearing apart food.</p>
